# Bikeshare Project :bike:

*This project was created on Thursday, 2021-11-25.*

The Bikeshare Project explores the bikeshare data from Divvy, a bicycle shareing system in the US. The project imports the source data and provides an interactive user frontend in a terminal application. The data is processed using Python 3, NumPy and Pandas.


### Files used

The bikeshare.py file contains the frontend and the data processing.

The source data is made available in three files:
 - chicago.csv
 - new_york_city.csv
 - washington.csv

*The source data is not pushed to github.*


### Credits
It's important to give proper credit. Add links to any repo that inspired you or blogposts you consulted.
